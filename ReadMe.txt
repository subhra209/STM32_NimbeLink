Project Descprition
1. On power on Device LED will be ON
2. On Power on Device LED will be blink With Delay (1/2 Second Cycle)
3. On Power on Device LED will be blink With Timer (1/2 Second Cycle)
4. On power on Device LED will be ON. LED power operate through Key Switch(ON/OFF)
5. On power on Device LED will be ON. LED power operate through Key Switch(BLINK/OFF)
6. Enable Debug UART, On device power on Print "Device started" in Terminal page
7. Recieve data in Debug UART, LoopBack should happen
8. LED operate(ON/Blink/Off) through DEBUG cmd
   LED ON  - Led will be ON
   LED BLINK - Led will be blink 
   LED OFF - Led should be off
9. Key switch should work as multi functional - Single press and double press
10.LED operation should shink with all type of External action
